# 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Output analysis
After having successfully started and accomplished a simulation run, the next step is to evaluate the simulation results. In case you have not yet conducted an own MAgPIE simulation or your simulation is still running, you can download model runs produced with the master branch of the GIT repository (https://github.com/magpiemodel/magpie/tree/master) for the MAgPIE4 release and copy the folders containing the simulation results into the **output** folder of your local version of the MAgPIE model.
The runs can be downloaded from: https://zenodo.org/record/2572620#.X8Zr9RbPw2w. They have been release together with the MAgPIE4 model description paper (https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/12/1299/2019/gmd-12-1299-2019-assets.html).

There are several ways to assess and evaluate MAgPIE results. This tutorial gives an overview on different tools and options that can be used to analyse model outputs. 

For each simulation, results are written to a folder that is created automatically as a combination of the **model title** and other information (as defined in the default.cfg via the command cfg$results_folder) inside the **output** folder of the model.


### 1.2 Learning objectives
The goal of this exercise is to use several tools for output analysis. After completion of this exercise, you'll be able to:

1. Use **model-internal R-scripts** for output analysis.
2. Know where to find the **automated validation PDF** and how it is structured.
3. Use the evaluation tool **appResultsLocal** of the library **shinyresults**.
4. Use the **magpie4 library** for output analysis.
5. Analyse outputs with the **gdx library**.


# 2 Model-internal R-scripts for output analysis

### 2.1 Execution of model-internal output scripts via the MAgPIE configuration file
In the file "config/default.cfg", it is possible to indicate which R-scripts are executed for output analysis after a model run is finished. Scripts evaluating single runs are stored in the folder **scripts/output/single**, while the folder **scripts/output/comparison** contains scripts that compare model output across several runs. In the default MAgPIE configuration, the scripts *rds_report* (to be used in appResultsLocal; see explanations below), *validation* and *interpolation* are selected via cfg$output: 

```{r, warning=FALSE, comment=NA,eval=FALSE}
cfg$output <- c("rds_report","validation","interpolation")
``` 

### 2.2 Execution of model-internal output scripts in the command window
Output scripts that are included in the folders **scripts/output/single** and **scripts/output/comparison** can also be executed via command window. To do so, windows users can open a command line prompt in the MAgPIE model folder by using **shift** + **right click** and then selecting *open command window here* option.

In the command prompt, use the following command:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
Rscript output.R
``` 

You are now asked to choose the output mode:
1: Output for single run
2: Comparison across runs

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Executing output scripts via command window", out.width = '70%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/Rscript_outputR.png")
```

In both cases, you can choose from the list of available model simulations, for which runs you want to conduct the model output analysis: 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Selection of model runs", out.width = '70%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/Rscript_output_runselection.png")
```

In the next step, you can interactively indicate which model-internal output scripts you want to execute:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Selection of model-internal output scripts", out.width = '70%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/Rscript_output_scriptselection.png")
```

The last step is to select the run submission type, e.g."Direct execution":

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Selection of run submission type", out.width = '70%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/Rscript_output_submissiontype.png")
```

Now, the selected script is executed. After completion, the results are written in the respective folder of the simulation run inside the **output** folder of the model.


### 2.3 Exercise
Execute the model-internal output script **report.R** via command window. This script collects the results of several report-functions - that calculate many key output variables like Production, Land Use or Yields - and writes them into one mif-file that can be read with text editors. Please refer to the `vignette("mif")` of the package *mip* (model intercomparison plots) to learn more about the mif format.


# 3 Automated model validation

### 3.1 Generation of validation pdfs
The automated model validation is an important example of output analysis based on model-internal scripts (see section 2). If the validation script is executed (either by selection via cfg$output as explained in 2.1. or by execution via the command window as explained in 2.2.), a standard evaluation PDF is created that validates numerous model outputs with a validation database containing historical data and projections for most outputs returned by the model, either visually or via statistical tests. A standard evaluation PDF consists of hundreds of evaluation outputs and usually has a length of around 1800 pages. By evaluating the model outputs on such a broad level rather than focusing only on key outputs, it allows getting a more complete picture of the corresponding simulation. As an example of such validation files, you can download the evaluation documents produced for all runs shown in the MAgPIE 4 framework paper (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1485303).


### 3.2 Coverage of model outputs
The table of contents of the validation PDF gives a good overview over the model outputs that can be simulated with a MAgPIE standard simulation, even though the validation PDF only shows a subset of possible model outputs:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Table of contents of the validation pdf", out.width = '70%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/toc_validationpdf.png")
```


### 3.3 Exercise
Open a validation pdf (either in a folder containing your own simulation results or the downloaded MAgPIE simulation runs, or the validation files that show results of the simulation runs used for the MAgPIE4 paper) and 

1. make yourself familiar with the structure of the document and the hierarchy of outputs as displayed by the table of contents and
2. have a look at some figures displaying model outputs of your interest.


# 4 Interactive scenario analysis
The automated model validation PDF is a good tool for visually evaluating a broad range of model outputs. However, comparison between model runs, i.e. between different scenarios, is rather difficult and inconvenient with the different model results being scattered across different large PDF files. 


### 4.1 Interactive scenario analysis with appResultsLocal
To overcome this issue, we developed the interactive scenario analysis and evaluation tools appResultsLocal (and appResults for the use within the PIK network) as part of the library **shinyresults** (https://github.com/pik-piam/shinyresults), which show evaluation plots for multiple scenarios including historical data and other projections based on an interactive selection of regions and variables. You can use this tool by running the following R command in the main folder of your model, which will automatically collect all runs in the output folder and visualize them: 

```{r comment=NA,eval=FALSE}
shinyresults::appResultsLocal()
```


This command opens an interactive window, where you can select the simulations that you want to evaluate. 


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Interactive MAgPIE app", out.width = '70%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/appResults_window.png")
```


You can use filters to select a subset of all runs stored in the output folder of the model, for example by searching for runs that have been finished at a certain day or by searching for keywords in the title of the simulation runs:


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Run selection by using a filter", out.width = '70%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/appResults_runselection.png")
```


### 4.2 Exercise
Choose *title* as filter and select 2 simulations that are stored in the output folder of your model, e.g. the SSP2 and SSP5 simulations from the downloaded set of MAgPIE runs:


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="How to use the title for filtering runs", out.width = '70%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/appResults_runselection_title.png")
```


After having selected the subset of runs that you want to analyse, click the button *Load selection*. Now, you can click on the tab *LinePLot*. You will then see on the right hand side line plots showing the development of population for historical and future time steps for all model regions and on the global scale:


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Regional and global development of population", out.width = '70%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/appResults_LinePlot.png")
```



Now, choose a variable of your interest, either by scrolling through the drop-down menu or write a key word in the input field, e.g. "cropland", to reduce the options in the menu.


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Selection of variables for line plots", out.width = '70%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/appResults_LinePlot_variables.png")
```

Make yourself familiar with the features of the app! You can, for example, select a subset of regions or a subset of time steps for which the results should be plotted. Moreover, you can free the y-axis, include or exclude validation data (if available) and download the plot.



# 5 Analysis of outputs with the magpie4 library

### 5.1 Overview on the magpie4 library 
If you want to go beyond visual output analysis and predefined output evaluation facilitated by scripts in the model folders **scripts/output/single** and **scripts/output/comparison**, you can use the functionality of the R package *magpie4* (https://github.com/pik-piam/magpie4). This library contains a list of common functions for extracting outputs from the MAgPIE model which are also the basis for the generation of the automated validation PDF. For a quick overview on the functions which are included in the library, you can have a look in the folder **magpie4/R**. The following figure shows a subset of R-files included in **magpie4/R**:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Subset of R functions of the magpie4 library", out.width = '70%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/subset_functions_magpie4.png")
```


For making yourself familiar with this library, you can open a R/RStudio session and set the MAgPIE model folder as working directory. This can be done by using the following command:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
setwd("/path/to/your/magpie/model/folder")
```

Then, load the library and call the help pages:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(magpie4)
?magpie4
```

You can click on the index and search for interesting functions, e.g. **carbonstock**, and read the respective help page:
 
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Help page of the carbonstock-function of the magpie4 library", out.width = '70%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/magpie4_help_carbonstock.png")
```
 
 
### 5.2 Exercise
Apply the function *carbonstock* for calculations in R, by using the file "fulldata.gdx" in the folder of a model simulation run as input for the function.

1. Use the default settings of the arguments of the function
2. Change the arguments of the function, e.g. set the level from "cell" to "reg".


# 6 Analysis of outputs with the gdx library
The **gdx library** (https://github.com/pik-piam/gdx) allows for directly accessing objects contained in the fulldata.gdx via the function **readGDX**.
A pragmatic way to learn how to use this function for the extraction of interesting information from the fulldata.gdx is to open R-files of the magpie4 library within Rstudio. Most of the magpie4 functions make use of **readGDX**. 

In the function *carbonstock* of the **magpie4** library, we see several instances where **readGDX** is used, e.g.:

```{r, warning=FALSE, comment=NA,eval=FALSE}
a <- readGDX(gdx,"ov_carbon_stock",select=list(type="level"),react="silent")
sm_cc_carbon <- readGDX(gdx,"sm_cc_carbon2",react = "silent")
ov_land <- readGDX(gdx,"ov_land",select = list(type="level"))
fm_carbon_density <- readGDX(gdx,"fm_carbon_density")[,t,]

```

It is possible to extract various GAMS objects like *"sets"*, *"equations"*, *"parameters"*, *"variables"* and *"aliases"* with **readGDX**.

With the argument *select=list(type="level")*, you can select the levels of endogenous variables, with *select=list(type="marginal")* you can extract the marginal values of these variables.
